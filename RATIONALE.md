# Go HTTP Service Documentation

## Project Overview
This service is designed as a lightweight, robust HTTP API server with built-in health monitoring, authentication middleware, and high availability considerations. The design emphasizes Go idioms and best practices while maintaining simplicity and extensibility.

## Directory Layout
```
go-http-service/
├── cmd/
│   └── server/
│       └── main.go           # Application entry point
├── internal/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── auth.go          # Authentication client and middleware
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.go        # Configuration management
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   └── handlers.go      # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── health/
│   │   └── health.go        # Health monitoring system
│   └── server/
│       └── server.go        # Core server implementation
```

The project follows the standard Go project layout:
- `cmd/`: Contains the main application entry points
- `internal/`: Houses packages that are private to this service
- Packages are separated by responsibility (auth, config, etc.)

## Library Choices

### HTTP Router: Chi
- Lightweight and idiomatic
- Middleware support
- Compatible with standard `net/http` handlers
- More flexible and less opinionated than alternatives like Gin

### HTTP Client: Resty
- Fluent API for making HTTP requests
- Built-in retry mechanisms
- Easy request/response handling
- Better developer experience than standard `http.Client`

### Circuit Breaker: Gobreaker
- Prevents cascading failures
- Configurable failure thresholds
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Essential for service resilience

### Error Group: errgroup
- Manages multiple goroutines
- Propagates errors effectively
- Provides coordinated cancellation
- Similar to Erlang supervision trees (though more limited)

## Health Check Implementation

### Design
The health check system is implemented using several key components:

1. `HealthManager`:
   - Central state management
   - Periodic health checks
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Extensible checker registration

2. `HealthChecker` interface:
   ```go
   type HealthChecker interface {
       Check(ctx context.Context) error
   }
   ```
   - Simple interface for implementing new checks
   - Context-aware for timeout/cancellation
   - Binary health state (error or no error)

3. Status reporting:
   - Detailed health status per component
   - Overall system health state
   - Timestamp of last checks
   - HTTP 503 response when unhealthy

### Features
- Periodic checks (default: 5 minutes)
- Thread-safe state management
- Extensible checker system
- Detailed health reporting

## API Implementation

### Design Principles
1. Middleware-based architecture
2. Standard HTTP status codes
3. JSON response format
4. Context-aware handlers
5. Graceful shutdown support

### Key Features
- Route grouping
- Authentication middleware
- Standardized error responses
- Request timeout handling
- Logging middleware

## Authentication Implementation

### Design
The authentication system is built with several key features:

1. Circuit Breaker Pattern:
   - Prevents cascading failures
   - Automatic recovery
   - Configurable thresholds

2. Token Validation:
   - External service validation
   - Middleware-based checking
   - Proper error handling

3. Retry Mechanism:
   - Automatic retries for transient failures
   - Exponential backoff
   - Maximum retry limits

## Expandability

### Adding New Features
1. Health Checks:
   ```go
   type NewChecker struct {
       // dependencies
   }

   func (c *NewChecker) Check(ctx context.Context) error {
       // implementation
   }

   // Registration
   healthManager.RegisterChecker("new-checker", newChecker)
   ```

2. API Endpoints:
   ```go
   r.Route("/api/v1", func(r chi.Router) {
       r.Get("/new-endpoint", h.NewHandler)
   })
   ```

3. Middleware:
   ```go
   r.Use(middleware.NewMiddleware)
   ```

### Integration Points
- AWS services (SNS/SQS) can be added
- Additional authentication methods
- Custom middleware
- New health checks
- Metrics/monitoring

## Considerations and Tradeoffs

### Performance
- Goroutine management for concurrent operations
- Context usage for cancellation/timeouts
- Circuit breaker to prevent resource exhaustion
- Connection pooling in HTTP client

### Reliability
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Retry mechanisms
- Graceful shutdown
- Health monitoring

### Security
- Authentication middleware
- Secure defaults
- Timeout middleware
- No sensitive data in logs

### Limitations
- No process isolation (unlike Erlang)
- Limited supervision tree capabilities
- In-memory health state (lost on restart)
- Single process architecture

## Best Practices

### Error Handling
- Use of `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping
- Context propagation
- Proper error types
- Logging at appropriate levels

### Configuration
- Environment variable based
- Sensible defaults
- Validation at startup
- Expandable config structure

### Testing
Recommended test approach:
1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. Mock external services
4. Test health check system
5. Circuit breaker testing

### Deployment
Considerations:
1. Health check endpoint for load balancers
2. Graceful shutdown handling
3. Configuration via environment variables
4. Logging setup
5. Metrics collection

## Future Improvements

1. Metrics
   - Prometheus integration
   - Request timing
   - Error rate tracking
   - Circuit breaker state

2. Logging
   - Structured logging
   - Log levels
   - Request ID tracking
   - Correlation IDs

3. Caching
   - Response caching
   - Token caching
   - Cache invalidation

4. Documentation
   - API documentation
   - Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Configuration reference
   - Deployment guide

## Conclusion
This service provides a solid foundation for building reliable HTTP APIs in Go. It incorporates industry best practices for reliability, maintainability, and extensibility while remaining relatively simple and straightforward to understand and modify.
